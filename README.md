# Cavemen
Programming special relativity in the CAVE.

## How to Contribute
First, fork the project to your own GitHub account. This only needs to be done once. Then, and this is the most important step, **create a branch** from the master repository. **Do not make changes directly to the master**.

## TODO
This is where we will store important items which can be checked off next.
- [x] Get everyone set up with GitHub
- [x] Get everyone set up with Unity
- [x] Get Unity set up with GitHub
- [x] Symplectic Integrators
	- [x] Create a symplectic integrator for central-force systems
- [x] Program a simple 1-D special relativistic length contraction based on the speed of the player
	- [x] Get a ball to contract in the x-direction
	- [x] Get the camera to move in 1-D and change its speed based on an input from the player.
- [ ] Work on a more advanced special relativistic system
	- [ ] Get objects to contract in the y,z directions
	- [ ] Allow free movement in 3-D for the camera
- [ ] Include acceleration into the system
	- [ ] Talk with Dr. Chuss about this
- [ ] Ultimate Goal: Create a minigame in 2 weeks (this one is a BIG if...)
